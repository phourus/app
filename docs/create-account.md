Getting started with Phourus is easy.  Click "Sign Up Now" and follow the steps.  First, type in a preferred username and password.  

Next, type your organization name.  If your organization already has a Phourus account, you can select it here.
If it hasn't been created yet, you'll be able to make a Phourus page for your organization. (If you just want to log on as an individual and select groups later, skip this step.)

Now you can confirm your Login, Organization Name, and Password and you're good to go.  Enjoy!
