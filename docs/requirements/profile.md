So the Profile page is for both Individual Users as well as Organizational Users. They will share a very similar structure, with a few minor differences.

HEADING
The Heading is the most crucial part, as it contains all of the user’s vital profile information, as well as links to the subviews that will display more in-depth information.

- Username (johndoe) or Shortname (Username for organizations, abc-company). This should also link to the default subview (more info below)
- User/Organization pic
- Influence Rank (Score 1-100, indicates how reputable and influential the user/organization is on Phourus). This should also link to the ‘Ranks' subview (more info below)
- Profile information (refer to Account page basic info — first/last name (John Doe) or Organization name (ABC Company, Inc))
     - First & Last name (Users) or Organization Name (Organizations)
     - Location (City & State)
     - User: Company, Occupation, Date of Birth, Gender
     - Org: Size (50-100 Employees), Type (Corporation), Industry (Energy) and Founded (July 1995)

LINKS
So the Links section is how users will navigate subviews of the Profile page. Most hyperlinks should include a total and link to the appropriate subview. For example, there should be a hyperlink that says ’16 Reviews’, which would be the total reviews written by that user, or for the organization. If that link is clicked, it would bring you to the Reviews subview to see that actual reviews.

1. Username/shortname: Should bring you to the default subview
2. Contact: A “Contact” link should bring you to the contact page for the user/organization
3. Influence Rank: The 'Influence Rank’ for the User/Organization should also link to the ‘Rank’ subview somehow

4. x Posts: Total number of posts, should bring you to the Search page (not a subview) with all the user’s posts
5. x Members/Organizations: An Organization has ‘Members’ (users who have joined the organization), while a user has ‘Organizations’ (how many Organizations the user belongs to)
6. x Events: The amount of events attending or hosting by the user/organization.
7. x Reviews:
