The Search Page is where users will find posts on Phourus. It’s a pretty standard search/results page and I’ve provided all of the details needed below:

SEARCH BAR
Need a search bar and search button

- Search by keyword, Users & Organizations
- Fuzzy search, search for
- Category & Tag searching
- Personalized Curation

SEARCH RESULTS
The list of search results is the primary focus of the page and very important. Each result should have data about the post, the author and have some statistics for such as total number of comments and views.

- Post
     - Title
     - Post Type (Blogs)
     - Category & Subcategory (History, Ancient History)
     - Summary/Excerpt
- User
     - Pic
     - Username
     - Location
     - User Influence Rank
- Stats
     - Total Views
     - Total Comments
     - Total likes
     - Popularity (0-100%)

SORT
Need to be able to sort search results.

- Sort ascending or descending by
     - Influence Rank
     - Views
     - Popularity (Ratio of likes to dislikes)
     - Likes
     - Comments
     - Location
     - Date

FILTER
There are 8 different Post Types on Phourus. Search should be able to turn these on/off somehow, as well as filter by date ranges.


- Post Type filters (Blogs, Events, Subjects, Questions, Debates, Polls, Quotes, Beliefs)
- Date range filter (Posts created between this date and that date)

PAGINATION
Users should be able to page through results.

- Next/Previous button
- Numbered pages 1,2,3…10 etc
- Total posts/current posts ("Displaying Posts 21 - 30" for example)
- Kind of think sticky pagination would be pretty cool, at least for mobile

The Post page is pretty straightforward. It is basically an article with a title, an author, some stats, as well as an upvote/downvote feature,  and a comments section.

Primary Objective: Typography
     - Headings, Paragraph, Lists, Fonts, Colors, Spacing

Main information
     - Title, post content
Meta information
     - Author name (as hyperlink), post category, post type, element, difficulty, etc.

View Counter
     - It should display a count of how many times the page has been viewed
Upvote/Downvote
     - Ability to up vote and down vote a Post
     - It should display a count of up votes and down votes e.g. 123 up/35 down
     - It should have a ‘Popularity’ ratio of 0-100% based on the ratio of down votes to up votes

Tags
     - It should have a clever and useful tag mechanism, such as a tag cloud
Links
     - It should have a section for links/attachments
          - images, video, audio, links to other webpages
Comments section
     - Should have a list of comments
          - Meta: User picture, username, user influence, date, comment, downvote/upvote
     - Should have an ‘Add Comment’ form
