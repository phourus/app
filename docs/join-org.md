Under "My Organizations" you can use the search bar to locate your organizations and add yourself to them.  

Type in the name of your organization and if a Phourus page already exists for it, it will pop up; just select it from the list.  

If your organization hasn't created a Phourus page yet and you don't see it on the list, you can begin the process of creating your organization's Phourus page by entering your company name in the "organization name" box and click "Create New Organization."

If your organization already exists, the Admin will approve your request and you're ready to start using Phourus.
