The Stream is the homepage for your company's knowledge and ideas.  It's where you can view a mosaic of your organization's most valuable, relevant, and discussion-worthy content updated in real time.

 Post types are categorized by color and organized by our proprietary crowdsorting algorithm, which brings content that is determined to be most discussed, most viewed, most shared, and most highly vetteed according to your own users.

The Stream gives you a constantly evolving flow of the ideas that allow the members of your organization with the very best and brightest ideas to stand out. It allows organization members to engage and contribute in a meaningful and constructive way, free from the hindrance of politics and hierarchies.
